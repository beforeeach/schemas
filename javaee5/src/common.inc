      The following conventions apply to all Java EE
      deployment descriptor elements unless indicated otherwise.

      - In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the
	same JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not
	starting with "/") are considered relative to the root of
	the JAR file's namespace.  Absolute filenames (i.e., those
	starting with "/") also specify names in the root of the
	JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative names are
	preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
	names are preferred for consistency with the Servlet API.
